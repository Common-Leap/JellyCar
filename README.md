## JellyCar is great 2d game with soft body physics created by Walaber https://twitter.com/walaber.

This is an updated homebrew version of the original project for many platforms
(PC, PSP, Wii, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo Switch), including Switch compatibility updates for current Atmosphere/libnx.

Current implementation uses [Andromeda-Lib](https://github.com/DrakonPL/Andromeda-Lib), patched during setup below.

## Build instructions

### Nintendo Switch

1. Clone both repositories as siblings:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DrakonPL/Andromeda-Lib
git clone https://github.com/Common-Leap/JellyCar.git JellyCar
```

Expected layout:

```txt
Workspace/
  Andromeda-Lib/
  JellyCar/
```

Run the remaining commands from the `Workspace/` directory shown above.

2. Install devkitPro + Switch toolchain and libs:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu devkitA64 libnx switch-tools \
  switch-pkg-config switch-mesa switch-glad switch-glm \
  switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_mixer switch-freetype switch-harfbuzz
```

3. Set environment variables:

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
export DEVKITA64=$DEVKITPRO/devkitA64
export PATH=$DEVKITA64/bin:$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin:$DEVKITPRO/portlibs/switch/bin:$PATH
```

4. Apply the required `Andromeda-Lib` compatibility patch for latest `libnx` (Switch exit/audio/font/shader fixes):

```sh
git -C Andromeda-Lib apply ../JellyCar/Build/Switch/andromeda-lib-libnx.patch
```

If this reports the patch is already applied, continue.

5. Build:

```sh
cd JellyCar/Build/Switch
make clean
make -j$(nproc)
```

By default, file logging is disabled (`FILE_LOG=0`), so no `Info*.txt` / `Error*.txt` debug files are written.
To enable file logging, build with:

```sh
make -j$(nproc) FILE_LOG=1
```

If `Andromeda-Lib` is not in the default sibling location:

```sh
make -j$(nproc) ANDROMEDA_LIB=/absolute/or/relative/path/to/Andromeda-Lib
```

The build now auto-stages `JellyCar/Assets` into `Build/Switch/romfs/Assets` and embeds it in `JellyCar.nro`, so no separate asset copy is required for normal use.

6. Deploy and run:

- Copy `JellyCar/Build/Switch/JellyCar.nro` to `sdmc:/switch/JellyCar/JellyCar.nro`.
- Launch from Homebrew Menu with title override (hold `R` while opening a game) to avoid applet-memory crashes.
- Optional override: if you want filesystem assets instead of embedded romfs, place `Assets` at `sdmc:/switch/JellyCar/Assets`.

For a release package, `JellyCar.nro` is the required runtime file.
